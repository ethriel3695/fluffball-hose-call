###### Are you skipping grooming visits because it’s stressful to get your pet into the car, or are you just looking for a more personalized experience?

In-home grooming is one of the newest trends in the pet grooming industry,
offering many of the perks of mobile grooming with a bit of a twist.

Fast growing in popularity, many pet owners are opting to have their groomers
work with their pets directly in their home - as opposed to a mobile grooming
van. Both offer similar levels of convenience, but in-home grooming offers a new
level of low-stress care where the pet parent can not only be sure where their
pet is being groomed, but also that their pet is in a safe and comfortable
environment familiar to them. This is not only great for anxious or senior pets,
but for animals that get overstimulated in new environments.

  Lauren Rowell (9/11/2018) Top 5 Reasons To Consider In-Home Grooming{' '}
</a>

As a house call groomer, I set up in your home, garage, or outside (weather
permitting) to groom your pets. Everything needed, including towels, is provided
by me, excluding a water, power source, vacuum and/or broom. I am flexible on
space, amenities, and location; I can work almost anywhere! While you are welcome
to be present, your presence is not required. I do not have age or breed
restrictions, but I do have an 80+ pound weight restriction.

So what happens for your pets appointment? Upon arrival, if I have not yet met
your pet, I will spend some time getting to know them! While this may seem like I
am simply petting your furry friend, I am also doing a hands-on inspection for
any lumps, bumps, growths, wounds, tender spots, any other health concerns, etc.
One of my main goals is to help your pet feel as comfortable as possible with me
and the grooming process. I will ask to see location for set up to verify
equipment will fit and to be sure I have a power source close enough to run extension
cords to, if needed. I will then “set up shop”, which includes shampoos, brushes,
forced air dryer, clippers, towels, grooming table, and a mat I lay on the floor
to keep hair contained. Once I've gotten all those pleasantries out of the way, I
will begin with bathing. Anal glands and ear cleaning will also be done at this time,
as well as any selected add-on services or packages. Once they are all clean, they
will be dried with a towel first and then with a forced air dryer. After your pet is
dry, it's time for brushing, a trim or a clip (full haircut), depending on what you
want done.

Once I am done and you've had a chance to look your pet over and are satisfied, I will
pack up, clean up and vacuum hair. I aim to leave everything in the same, or better,
condition than when I started, however, please note this just isn't always completely
possible. Example- hair blowing across yard in the wind.

After I'm all packed, loaded & ready to go, I will discuss all groom notes and address
any health concerns. At this point, we can schedule a future appointment if you'd like
to re-book with me. I often book weeks in advance so prebooking is recommended to be assured
a spot in your preferred time frame.

Still undecided on whether house call grooming is right for you & your furry friend?
Let's take a look at some other important information!

If your pet is a senior or immunocompromised in any way, being in an environment with other
pets puts them at unnecessary risk.

In home grooming allows for you to control nearly every aspect in the grooming environment.
This means no unfamiliar pets, less potential for transfer of communicable pet diseases &
overall low stress levels, as they can be relaxed & comfortable in a familiar environment!

Senior or disabled pets may not get the close, gentle care & attention they need in a busy salon,
but I am able to spend extended one-on-one time with them, completely focusing on their
special requirements!

Pets receive individual, personalized & dedicated care without the stress of the salon atmosphere.

Anxious, nervous, senior, disabled, or pets fearful of travel, crates, strange places,etc.,
have a much easier time being groomed in the comfort & security of their own home

Grooming a pet in their own home builds a special bond between the groomer, the owner and the pets.

There's no transporting pets, no leaving the house if you choose not to, & not having to
worry about making it in time for pet pick up.

House call grooming is a great choice for elderly clients who may have trouble getting their pet
to a salon and also for active families who may not have time to worry about when pets
can be picked up or dropped off.

I invite clients to watch, learn proper bathing/brushing techniques for in between appointments,
ask questions, visit, and most importantly, see every step we take with their pets! Occasionally,
I may have to ask clients to step out of the room or out of view if pet becomes too worked up
this is strictly done for your pets safety!!

“Difficult” or “aggressive” pets can be less so when not faced with strange smells, sounds,
sights & people in the chaotic environment of a busy salon.

House call grooming is a luxury service that may not be for everyone and I understand that.
