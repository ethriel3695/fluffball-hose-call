###### Are you skipping grooming visits because itâ€™s stressful to get your pet into the car, or are you just looking for a more personalized experience?

In-home grooming is one of the newest trends in the pet grooming industry,
offering many of the perks of mobile grooming with a bit of a twist.

Fast growing in popularity, many pet owners are opting to have their groomers
work with their pets directly in their home - as opposed to a mobile grooming
van. Both offer similar levels of convenience, but in-home grooming offers a new
level of low-stress care where the pet parent can not only be sure where their
pet is being groomed, but also that their pet is in a safe and comfortable
environment familiar to them. This is not only great for anxious or senior pets,
but for animals that get overstimulated in new environments.

  Lauren Rowell (9/11/2018) Top 5 Reasons To Consider In-Home Grooming{' '}
</a>

As a house call groomer, I set up in your home, garage, or outside (weather
permitting) to groom your pets. Everything needed, including towels, is provided
by me, excluding a water, power source, vacuum and/or broom. I am flexible on
space, amenities, and location; I can work almost anywhere! While you are welcome
to be present, your presence is not required. I do not have age or breed
restrictions, but I do have an 80+ pound weight restriction.

So what happens for your pets appointment? Upon arrival, if I have not yet met
your pet, I will spend some time getting to know them! While this may seem like I
am simply petting your furry friend, I am also doing a hands-on inspection for
any lumps, bumps, growths, wounds, tender spots, any other health concerns, etc.
One of my main goals is to help your pet feel as comfortable as possible with me
and the grooming process. I will ask to see location for set up to verify
equipment
