Hi! My name is Kirsi Ball, and I'm the owner and groomer of
Fluff Ball House Call. I've been grooming for 3+ years and
have worked with animals most of my life.

I grew up owning and loving all kinds of animals and insects.
I was raised around horses, cattle, cats, dogs, snakes, spiders
and everything in between. I always knew that I would work in
an animal related field, but felt like there were always too
many options.

I initially got into grooming when I was working in a doggie
daycare/boarding facility. Among those services, we also
offered training and grooming. I was given the opportunity
to learn how to groom and that was just the beginning!
I started from the basics of learning how to properly bathe
and brush and quickly learned clipping and breed cuts.

Grooming became a passion and a career, and I take pride
in saying that I am a dog groomer. A lot of time, education
and skill is put into pet grooming, but I wouldn't
have it any other way. I love working with animals and it
is so fulfilling to be able to make your pet look and
feel their best!

I am very intrigued by the changing styles of the profession
and I attend seminars whenever possible. I am always
excited to learn new techniques and bring back
technical skills to use in my own work.

I have enjoyed working in salons with other groomers, but
it's always been my dream to run my own business and to be
creative and professional in my own way. I am a groomer who
truly cares about your pets and I treat every animal
with the same love and care that I give my own.
